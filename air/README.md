🏗️ Air Quality Construction Dashboard

A web-based dashboard to monitor and visualize Air Quality Index (AQI) around construction sites, spread awareness about CPCB guidelines, and suggest low-cost mitigation measures. The platform helps construction companies, workers, and nearby communities stay informed and compliant.

🚀 Features
📊 Live AQI Data – Fetches real-time AQI data (from APIs or uploaded CSV).
📈 AQI Trend Charts – Line/bar charts showing AQI variations over time.
🛡️ CPCB Guidelines – Highlights key rules construction sites must follow.
✅ Compliance Checklist – Self-audit for site managers to stay compliant.
🌱 Mitigation Suggestions – Low-cost measures like water spraying, dust nets, and vegetation barriers.
📡 Community QR – Share a QR code for nearby residents to access live dashboards.
🔮 Predicted AQI – Simple ML model to forecast upcoming AQI levels.
🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite
Charts: Recharts
Backend (Optional): Python/Streamlit for ML models
Deployment: Render / Vercel
